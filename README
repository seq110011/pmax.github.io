I am trying to create a Jekyll
"plain text into static websites" here.
Thereby I run into various problems.
Github control via ssh (creating tokens
githubclient for terminal control 
and terminal control at all).

The upload function is not done.
It turned out that the command "sync" 
updates the data with the state of the cloud
and not from my computer.
(start all over again)


git add .             ( remembers all modified / added files 
                        to the commit )
git commit            ( adds a description to the change )
git push              ( Uplaud remote files to GIT )

gh repo create org/repo --enable-issues=true --public --push
( create a ney repo and make my editor as owner on this repo)
gh repo fork
(insert a user organisation to a part of this repo )

When these things are done
I start to create the config.
