I am trying to create a Jekyll
"plain text into static websites" here.
Thereby I run into various problems.
Github control via ssh (creating tokens
githubclient for terminal control 
and terminal control at all).

The upload function is not done.
It turned out that the command "sync" 
updates the data with the state of the cloud
and not from my computer.
(start all over again)

When these things are done
I start to create the config.
